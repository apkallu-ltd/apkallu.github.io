you contact us.

**Personal Information Provided by You.** The personal information that we collect
depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you
make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect
may include the following:
* names
* email addresses
* passwords
* gender
* date of birth
* bio
* profile pictures

**Sensitive Information.** We do not process sensitive information.

**Social Media Login Data.** We may provide you with the option to register with us
using your existing social media account details, like your Facebook, X, or other
social media account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect certain
profile information about you from the social media provider, as described in the
section called '[HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?](#7-how-do-we-handle-your-social-logins)' below.

**Application Data.** If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following
information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:
* _Mobile Device Data._ We automatically collect device information (such as your
mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version
information and system configuration information, device and application
identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model Internet
service provider and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or
proxy server). If you are using our application(s), we may also collect
information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your
mobile device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you
use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, and information about the features
of our application(s) you accessed.
* _Push Notifications._ We may request to send you push notifications regarding
your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out
from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your
device's settings.

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our
application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting
purposes.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate,
and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

### Information automatically collected
_**In Short:** Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or
browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our
Services._

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the
Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or
contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP
address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how
and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is
primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar
technologies.

The information we collect includes:
* _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic,
usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when
you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on
how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device
information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in
the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages
and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features
you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports
(sometimes called 'crash dumps'), and hardware settings).
* _Device Data._ We collect device data such as information about your computer,
phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on
the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP
address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers,
location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or
mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
* _Location Data._ We collect location data such as information about your
device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much
information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use
to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies
to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by
refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your
device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
aspects of the Services.

### Google API

Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy),
[User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the
[Limited Use requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use).

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

_**In Short:** We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our
Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply
with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent._

**We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on

* **To save or protect an individual's vital interest.** We may process your
information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest,
such as to prevent harm.

## 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

_**In Short:** We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary
and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like
with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or
fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate
business interests._

_**<u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u>**_

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain
the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As
such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

* **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission
(i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can
withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your
consent.
* **Performance of a Contract.** We may process your personal information when
we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including
providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with
you.
* **Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is
reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those
interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
purposes described in order to:
  * Send users information about special offers and discounts on our
products and services
  * Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising content for
our users
  * Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage
and retain users
  * Support our marketing activities
  * Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities
  * Understand how our users use our products and services so we can
improve user experience
* **Legal Obligations.** We may process your information where we believe it is
necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with
a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal
rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
involved.
* **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is
necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party,
such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

_**<u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u>**_

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.
express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You
can [withdraw your consent](#withdrawing-your-consent) at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
process your information without your consent, including, for example:
* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
obtained in a timely way
* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to
assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next
of kin
* If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
victim of financial abuse
* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise
the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is
reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
rules of the court relating to the production of records
* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business,
or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
information was produced
* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
* If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

## 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

_**In Short:** We may share information in specific situations described in this section
and/or with the following categories of third parties._

**Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share
your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (**'third
parties'**) who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such
information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which
are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they
cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to
do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organisation apart
from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it
for the period we instruct.

The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as
follows:
* Ad Networks
* Cloud Computing Services
* Communication & Collaboration Tools
* Performance Monitoring Tools
* Testing Tools
* User Account Registration & Authentication Services
* Website Hosting Service Providers

We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
* **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection
with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing,
or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
* **Other Users.** When you share personal information (for example, by posting
comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise interact
with public areas of the Services, such personal information may be viewed by
all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in
perpetuity. If you interact with other users of our Services and register for our
Services through a social network (such as Facebook), your contacts on the
social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your
activity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity,
communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile.

## 5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?

_**In Short:** We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with
third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not
affiliated with, our Services._

The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications
and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and
which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not
make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for
any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or
applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or
application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety
and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third
parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or
privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other
websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You
should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond
to your questions.

## 6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

_**In Short:** We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store
your information._

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels)
to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking
technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent
crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.

We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies
on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display
advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned
shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third
parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about
products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our
Services or on other websites.

To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a 'sale'/'sharing'
(which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under
applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by
submitting a request as described below under section
'[DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?](#14-do-united-states-residents-have-specific)'

### Google Analytics

We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyse the use of
the Services. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across the Services,
visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the
[Google Privacy & Terms page](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

_**In Short:** If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media
account, we may have access to certain information about you._

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this,
we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider.
The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile
picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social
media platform.

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.
Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that
you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites
and apps.

## 8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

_**In Short:** We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other
than your own._

Our servers are located in the United States and United Kingdom. If you are
accessing our Services from outside the United States and United Kingdom, please
be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in
our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal
information (see
['WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?'](#4-when-and-with-whom-do-we-share-your-personal-information)
above), in the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries.
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or
Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or
other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take
all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this
privacy notice and applicable law.

European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:

We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by
using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of
personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-
party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal
information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with
European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses
can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards
with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided
upon request.

## 9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

_**In Short:** We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes
outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose
in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not
possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

_**In Short:** We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
organisational and technical security measures._

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational
security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
Services within a secure environment.

## 11. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

_**In Short:** We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years
of age._

We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of
age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you
represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a
minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that
personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
children under age 18, please contact us at help@apkallu.co.uk.

## 12. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

_**In Short:** Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such
as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and
Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time,
depending on your country, province, or state of residence._


In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain
rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv)
if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-
making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting
us by using the contact details provided in the section
['HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'](#17-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice) below.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data
protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing
your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your
[Member State data protection authority](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en)
or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the
[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

### Withdrawing your consent

If we are relying on your consent to process your
personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
provided in the section '[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#17-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice)'
below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your
personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
consent.

### Opting out of marketing and promotional communications

You can unsubscribe
from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the
unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details
provided in the section ['HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'](#17-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice)
below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still
communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are
necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service
requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

### Account Information

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
terminate your account, you can:
* Log in to your account settings and update your user account.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your
account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some
information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
requirements.

### Cookies and similar technologies
Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies
by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove
cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this
could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also
[opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/)
on our Services.
If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
help@apkallu.co.uk.

## 13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your
privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond
to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
version of this privacy notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT
signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising
or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

## 14. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

_**In Short:** If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,
Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and
receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we
have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal
information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing
of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by
